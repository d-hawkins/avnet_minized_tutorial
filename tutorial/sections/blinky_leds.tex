\section{Blinky LED Designs}
% =============================================================================

The MiniZed has three LEDs;
%
\begin{itemize}
\item A bicolor LED connected to the Processor System (PS).
\item A bicolor LED connected to the Programmable Logic (PL).
\item A blue LED connected to the programmable logic configuration controller
DONE output.
\end{itemize}
%
The design examples in this section show how to blink the LEDs using
software running on the PS. The hardware designs differ in how the
LEDs are controlled by the PS;
%
\begin{itemize}
\item PS bicolor LED control via PS GPIO MIO (no PL use).
\item PL bicolor and blue LED control via the PS GPIO EMIO.
\item PL bicolor and blue LED control using an AXI GPIO.
\end{itemize}
%
These simple designs demonstrate how the PS and PL are configured using
Vivado, and how bare-metal applications are created using the Software
Development Kit (SDK).
