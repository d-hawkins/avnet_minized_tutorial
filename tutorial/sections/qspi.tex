\subsection{QSPI Flash}
% =============================================================================

Create an application that uses the QSPI PS library to access the flash.
The application should support all the flash features via the UART or
WiFi interface. Write a PC-side application that allows you to read
and write the contents of flash. Use this to read the contents of
a MiniZed that has never been programmed, and one restored to factory
defaults.

Use the Xilinx QSPI code to read the flash and calculate the CRC32 using
the same code I used under Cygwin. This would demonstrate a pretty basic
use of the library.

Extend this application to access the eMMC too?
