Programmable Logic Only.

Blink an LED from the internal oscillator, the external oscillator (none),
and an PS oscillator.

Select which oscillator using the select switch?

Or just blink the blue LED using the internal oscillator clock and
the bi-color LED using the PS clock.

If the QSPI flash is erased, or the PS design does not enable the FCLK,
then the counter clocked by the PS does not increment.

Describe the use of unmanaged constraints.
